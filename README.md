# 🧩 Agile Final Project – Sprint Planning and Execution

This repository contains my final project for the **Agile Development** course.  
It demonstrates the complete Scrum workflow — from creating user stories and refining the product backlog to sprint planning, execution, and tracking — using **GitHub Projects** (or **ZenHub**).

---

## 📘 Overview
In this project, I played the roles of:
- **Product Owner** – Created and prioritized user stories based on stakeholder requirements.  
- **Scrum Master** – Organized sprint planning, managed backlog refinement, and facilitated team progress tracking.  
- **Developer** – Simulated sprint execution by moving stories across the Kanban board.

The goal is to develop the **back-end product catalog** for an e-commerce website.  
This catalog supports creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and liking/disliking products, hosted on the cloud with automated deployment.

## 📋 Stakeholder Requirements

| # | Requirement |
|---|--------------|
| 1 | Need the ability to create a product in the catalog |
| 2 | Need the ability to retrieve a product from the catalog |
| 3 | Need the ability to update a product in the catalog |
| 4 | Need the ability to delete a product from the catalog |
| 5 | Need the ability to Like a product |
| 6 | Need the ability to Dislike a product |
| 7 | Need the ability to list all products in the catalog |
| 8 | Need the ability to query a subset of products |
| 9 | Must be hosted in the cloud |
| 10 | Must have automation to deploy new changes to the cloud |

## 🧠 Agile Artifacts

### 🗂️ Product Backlog
All 10 stakeholder requirements were transformed into **user stories** and added to the Kanban board.  
Each story was written using the industry-standard Agile format to ensure clarity and user focus:

> **As a `<type of user>`, I need `<a goal>`, so that `<reason or value>`.**

This structure connects every feature to a real user need and its business value, ensuring traceability and purpose in development.  
Below are examples of finalized user stories:

- 🧩 **Create Product**  
  *As a catalog administrator, I need the ability to create and manage products in the catalog so that I can maintain an up-to-date list of items available for sale.*

- ❤️ **Like Product**  
  *As a customer, I need the ability to like products so that I can show interest in items and help the system recommend similar ones.*

- ☁️ **Cloud Hosting**  
  *As a system engineer, I need the service to be hosted in the cloud so that it is scalable and always available to users.*

All stories follow this format to communicate intent, outcomes, and measurable goals, ensuring clarity during backlog refinement and sprint planning.

### 🔧 Labels
To maintain clarity and organization, stories were tagged with labels:
- `enhancement` → for new or improved features  
- `technical debt` → for remaining or incomplete work from previous sprints  

---

### 🏁 Sprint Setup
- **Sprint Name:** Sprint 1  
- **Duration:** 2 weeks  
- **Included Stories:** Top 4 user stories from the Product Backlog  
- **Story Point Estimates:** Assigned collaboratively during sprint planning  

---

## 🏗️ Sprint Execution

The sprint was executed in simulation mode to reflect a real Scrum process:
1. The top story was assigned to me and moved to **In Progress**.  
2. Upon completion, it was moved to **Review/QA** for verification.  
3. The next story was started while the previous one moved to **Done**.  
4. The sprint concluded with one story remaining **In Progress** to simulate ongoing development.  

This sequence represents a realistic sprint flow that balances progress tracking, workload visibility, and sprint continuity.

## 📉 Burndown Chart
A **Burndown Chart** was generated to visualize the number of story points completed versus remaining throughout the sprint.  
This provides a clear view of the team’s velocity and overall sprint progress.

**Columns Used:**
- **Icebox** – Low-priority or future stories  
- **Product Backlog** – Stories prepared for upcoming sprints  
- **Sprint Backlog** – Stories selected for the active sprint  
- **In Progress** – Stories currently being developed  
- **Review/QA** – Stories under review or testing  
- **Done** – Completed and verified stories  

This board structure reflects an effective Agile workflow, ensuring transparency, traceability, and smooth collaboration across roles.
